      <p>A method is a piece of code that is called by name that is associated with an object. In most respects it is identical to a function except for two key differences.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>It is implicitly passed for the object for which it was called.</li>
          <li>It is able to operate on data that is contained within the class (remembering that an object is an instance of a class - the class is the definition, the object is an instance of that data).</li>
        </ol>
        <p>All JavaScript objects have methods by default, for instance all strings can have the search() method called on them which will search a string for a specified value and return the position of the match.</p>
        <p>Numbers in JavaScript have the .toFixed() method which  will round to the nearest whole number. Here's how we can tell it how many decimal places to use:</p>
        <p>46.1.toFixed(2);</p>
        <p>returns: "46.10"</p>
