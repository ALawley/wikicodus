      <h5>divs:</h5>
      <p>The &lt;div&gt; tag does nothing on its own: it's just a place to add a class that is then applied to everything that is nested within it. It's very common to apply styles by using &lt;div&gt; tags to separate the content of your pages.</p>
      <h5>spans:</h5>
      <p>&lt;span&gt; elements are similar in that they do not have or need any attributes of their own. They are also useful in a similar manner for adding specific styles by adding classes, but they are used inline instead of block.</p>
      <p>Refer to the block and inline element pages for examples of each!</p>
