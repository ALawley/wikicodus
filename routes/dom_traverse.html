      <p>jQuery provides powerful tools for finding the element or elements you're after, and then working with those elements to achieve a desired result. Through its traversal and manipulation methods, it takes tasks that would be rather painful to achieve using native DOM manipulation, and makes those tasks fairly straightforward and intuitive jQuery lets us "traverse" — or move through — the HTML elements that make up our page. jQuery's manipulation methods allow you to alter the DOM of your page using a syntax that's much friendlier than the one provided by native DOM manipulation methods.</p>
      <p>$('selector') is the syntax for jQuery to select an element within the DOM in order to manipulate it. $ being the jQuery shorthand keyword and selector being any CSS selector.</p>
      <p>jQuery has myriad of methods that can be called on the selected element for example $('selector').addClass('className'); would be a use that adds a class to the specified element.</p>
